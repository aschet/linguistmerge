Merging Qt localization TS files from multiple feature or release branches or reintegrating a delivery of a translation agency into the active development cycle can be quite challenging. LinguistMerge set out to ease this task. Think of it as a simplified lconvert with UI and the ability to combine duplicated messages. In the beginning this project startet out as a redesign of the [Merge-Qt-TS-files](https://github.com/savolai/Merge-Qt-TS-files) application but is now fully rewritten from scratch.
